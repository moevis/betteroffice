# @betteroffice/docx-native

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c9a8850: The native `EditSession` now also lays out, builds display frames, measures fonts, takes resident input, hit tests and reports update callbacks, and every WebAssembly engine function is exported with the same name and results.
- e9fbbe6: Replaces the native facade with the same entry points and API as `@betteroffice/docx`, backed by the native engine by default. Import `@betteroffice/docx-native` for Node.js, Bun and Deno without WebAssembly initialization or assets.

### Patch Changes

- e1a414e: Documents whose XML parts start with a byte order mark and have bookmarks between paragraphs now save. Before, saving them failed with a malformed XML error.
- 3c1c056: Native DOCX page rendering is up to ten times faster on pages with clipped content. Pixel output is unchanged.
- a9b74ab: Preserves bookmarks inside complex field results when saving, including fields that span paragraphs in the document body or table cells.
- 0a4285c: Adds opt-in `fontPreflight`, returning DOCX font faces, script keys, and scan completeness without the editing engine. Its standalone module loads only when called or explicitly loaded with `preloadPreflightWasm`.
- c3c5294: Picture watermarks that Word also places in a footer are kept when the document is saved.
- fa2717d: Every engine now reads decimal numbers back exactly. Drawing groups whose scaled child coordinates have long decimals stay intact on save.
- 773c633: Keeps bookmarks in table cells, content controls, headers, footers, notes, comments and text boxes on save, including after blocks are deleted, merged or moved.
- 8efeef9: Keeps bookmarks inside field codes, such as the one Word writes for each legacy form field, and fields nested inside another field's code, on save.
- 51a1bbf: Keeps drawing groups and canvases on save in headers, footers and rewritten paragraphs. A group that matches its source apart from its frame and text-box text is written back from the source with those changes; any other edit writes it from the model as before.
- 30134ef: Keeps bookmarks that sit between table rows or between cells on save, including after rows or columns are inserted or deleted in an editing session.
- bf8880c: Keeps bookmarks inside the paragraphs of text boxes on save, including the copies Word stores for older versions.
- f777004: Keeps a text box on its own run on save when bookmarks, comment ranges or other markers come before it in the paragraph; such a text box was dropped or moved to another run.
- f31b62e: Keeps text boxes inside tracked insertions, deletions, hyperlinks and simple fields on save, with their text and revision marks.
- dbcc3fd: Undo grouping reads JavaScript `Date.now`, as the wasm engine does, so edits group the same way on both engines, including under a mocked clock.
- 2dbba20: `@betteroffice/docx-native` installs the Latin, international and CJK font packs and reads each default face from disk on first use, so international and CJK text gets its bundled face with nothing fetched.
- 514e876: Story checksums use constant memory, so long documents no longer exhaust the WebAssembly engine's memory and stop the editor. Checksum values are unchanged.
- c74b2b8: The docx editing engine is smaller to download.
- 0bee43d: Text runs drawn without shaping carry the script faces their paragraph needs (`scripts`), so the native renderer requests the Japanese, Korean or Traditional Chinese face the browser path already chooses.
- ad45f86: Adds opt-in `decodeFontFace` for packed fonts. Format package roots return a promise of `font` and optional `payload` ArrayBuffers; native bindings return byte arrays synchronously. Invalid options and decode errors reject or throw without retrying another decoder.
- 1af9969: Adds prebuilt binaries for musl Linux on x64 and arm64, such as Alpine, and for Windows on arm64.
- ec04baa: The native packages require Node.js 20.16+ or 22.3+, which they need to read installed font packs from disk.
- 681b02e: A Rust panic in a native engine now fails its session as a trap, as on WebAssembly, instead of aborting the process. The engine object that panicked refuses every later call except free.
- 6378188: Worker sessions now run on Node.js >= 20.16 / 22.3 through `worker_threads`, keeping the process alive until disposed. DOCX worker editing needs `OffscreenCanvas` and fails with a clear error without it (Node.js, Bun, Deno); open, read and save still work.
- 7cf70f8: Worker entries no longer import the module that constructs their own worker, so Next.js (Turbopack) production builds of apps that use `./worker` finish instead of hanging.
- 55c25ba: Worker files and main-thread entries import no private `#` specifiers, so worker sessions open from a CDN or with an import map, without a bundler. On Node.js, a worker thread that fails to start now fails the session instead of throwing synchronously.

### Patch Changes

- c688743: Adds prebuilt Rust engines for Node.js, Bun and Deno that open, edit, render PNGs and save documents. Image decoding stays within the render budget.
